This is a simple Java EE 6 application to perform the same as:

     <Location />
     RedirectMatch 301 ^/(.*) http://www.example.com/$1
     </Location>
     
Currently the www.example.com is hard wired. Let's fix that.

(This app was generated by hacking a JBoss example, by Pete Muir - hence his name and probably some comments in the code).
